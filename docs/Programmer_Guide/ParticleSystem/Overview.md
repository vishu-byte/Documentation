## System of Particles
A particle system is a collection of discrete entities called particles. Each particle is
described by its state and a collection of attributes. We implement the concept of a particle system
with classes: [`#!c++ Particles`](../ParticleSystem/Class:Particles/Description.md) and [`#!c++ ParticleSystem`](../ParticleSystem/Class:ParticleSystem/Description.md)
