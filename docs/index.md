## Welcome to My documentation
This is the home page.
I will be hosting documentation for my general-purpose particle system simulator here.


Organization of this material is simple and as readable as it can be.
This site will work as a live progress as well as documentation for my project.


1. The benefit of this code is that it generalized; it acts as a base version that can be made specific by adding

It has git tracking as well.


??? note
    This project is complete in itself, but it can still be improved. I am working on these improvements and addition
    of several other features.
